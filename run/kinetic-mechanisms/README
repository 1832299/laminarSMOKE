Detailed kinetic mechanisms
========================================================================
The kinetic mechanisms contained in this folder can be freely downloaded
in CHEMKIN format (together with thermodynamic and transport properties) 
from the CRECK Modeling Group (Politecnico di Milano) at the following 
web address:

CHEMKIN Pre-processor
========================================================================
In order to use a detailed kinetic mechanism (available in CHEMKIN
format) in laminarSMOKE you need to pre-process it using the 
OpenSMOKE++ kinetic preprocessor (available in the solvers folder).

Please consider that some of the kinetic mechanisms available in this 
folder have been already pre-processed (you can recognize them because 
of the presence of XML files).
